# The Walker Configuration File
#
# Walker was made to run with sensible default values, so most configuration
# keys are documented here but commented out. The values set here are the
# defaults.

# Whether to dynamically add new-found domains (or their links) to the crawl (a
# broad crawl) or discard them, assuming desired domains are manually seeded.
#add_new_domains: false

# Configure the User-Agent header
#user_agent: Walker (http://github.com/iParadigms/walker)

# Crawl delay (in seconds) to use when unspecified by robots.txt
#default_crawl_delay: 1

# Maximum size of http content
#max_http_content_size_bytes

# For the purpose of parsing out links for crawling, walker looks at the
# following tags:
#   - a, area, form, frame, iframe, script, link, img
# It ignores several by default.
#ignore_tags: [script, img, link]

# The maximum number of links to parse from a page for further crawling.
#max_links_per_page

# How many simultaneous fetchers will your crawlmanager run
#num_simultaneous_fetchers: 1

# Cassandra configuration for the datastore.
# Generally these are used to create a gocql.ClusterConfig object
# (https://godoc.org/github.com/gocql/gocql#ClusterConfig).
#
# keyspace shouldn't generally need to be changed; it is mainly changed in
# testing as an extra layer of safety.
#
# replication_factor is used when defining the keyspace.
#cassandra:
#    hosts: ["localhost"]
#    keyspace: "walker"
#    replication_factor: 3
